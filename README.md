This project aimed to read data from a file, output that data into a new file, and display the data to the user in various ways based on input. I think I did a good job organizing the code, such as limiting the amount of functions in the main file and using whitespace to separate distinct parts of the code. I also tried accounting for incorrect inputs from the user and tried to make the user experience better by allowing input to be case-insensitive. I found the read and write function to be one of the more difficult parts. I had trouble opening the input file, so I ended up using the exact file path where the file was stored. I think it would be better to just have the file name there, but I couldn't get that to work. I tried to make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using whitespace to separate funtions. I also used a header file with a separate .cpp file for the larger functions. This allowed me to keep the main file small and easier to read. I think maintaining code like this is important so that other programmers can read and edit it if needed, so I will be transfering these skills to my furture projects to continue making efficient and readable programs.
